Mac gaming guides
=================

This repo collects guides that would help you play certain games on your desktop and laptop Apple device. 

Currently, we're focused on detailing the ways to play [source ports](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_port) by bringing game data from the games you own on Steam and GOG.com.

To streamline the guides we'll split the common operations that are not game specific into separate general guides and then, individual games would refer to and detail those guides.

By following this guide you should be able to achieve all of the tasks on your Mac, without using another operating system. When possible we'll try to suggest couple options to achieve the same goal and highlight the difference.

Happy gaming!
